[Major Problems]
(?x)# Fail to render multiline regex properly
[
This should have worked (at least optionally)
]


[NOT IMPLEMENTED]
(?x)#1. Not supporting Perl extended character class
?[qwq&&awa]

(?x)#2. UTF mode which allows unicode escape
(*UTF) \N{U+003f}

(?x)#3. Duplicating group name constraint
(?-J)(?<as>a)(?<as>a)

(?x)#4. An error is marked when group name is longer than 128 chars, however, it should be 128 code units

(?x)#5. Semantic highlight when involving group name

(?x)#6. When use are refering to a group in back reference, condition or subroutine, we don't check if the group with that name does exist 
\g{unknown} (?(<unknown>)|) (?&unknown)

(?x)#7. Callouts (external function entries, which is not supported in Godot)
(?C1)abc(?C2)def
